// will receive a callback, exactly as if they were communicating over the network.  You must

// cause the socket pair to send packets through the local network loopback device (127.0.0.1)
// on ephemeral ports.  Fake lag and loss are supported in this case, and CPU time is expended
// to encrypt and decrypt.
//
// If you wish to assign a specific identity to either connection, you may pass a particular

// SendMessages is the interface to ISteamNetworkingSockets::SendMessages

// on the stack or allocate your own.)
//
// You should fill in the message payload.  You can either let
// it allocate the buffer for you and then fill in the payload,
// or if you already have a buffer allocated, you can just point
// m_pData at your buffer and set the callback to the appropriate function
// to free it.  Note that if you use your own buffer, it MUST remain valid
// until the callback is executed.  And also note that your callback can be
// invoked at ant time from any thread (perhaps even before SendMessages
// returns!), so it MUST be fast and threadsafe.
//
// You MUST also fill in:
//  - m_conn - the handle of the connection to send the message to
//  - m_nFlags - bitmask of k_nSteamNetworkingSend_xxx flags.
//
// All other fields are currently reserved and should not be modified.
//
// The library will take ownership of the message structures.  They may

// after passing them to this function.
//
// pOutMessageNumberOrResult is an optional array that will receive,
// for each message, the message number that was assigned to the message
// if sending was successful.  If sending failed, then a negative EResult

// Accept is the interface to ISteamNetworkingSockets::AcceptConnection
//
// Accept an incoming connection that has been received on a listen socket.
//
// When a connection attempt is received (perhaps after a few basic handshake
// packets have been exchanged to prevent trivial spoofing), a connection interface
// object is created in the k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_Connecting state
// and a SteamNetConnectionStatusChangedCallback_t is posted.  At this point, your
// application MUST either accept or close the connection.  (It may not ignore it.)
// Accepting the connection will transition it either into the connected state,
// or the finding route state, depending on the connection type.
//
// You should take action within a second or two, because accepting the connection is
// what actually sends the reply notifying the client that they are connected.  If you
// delay taking action, from the client's perspective it is the same as the network
// being unresponsive, and the client may timeout the connection attempt.  In other
// words, the client cannot distinguish between a delay caused by network problems
// and a delay caused by the application.
//
// This means that if your application goes for more than a few seconds without
// processing callbacks (for example, while loading a map), then there is a chance
// that a client may attempt to connect in that interval and fail due to timeout.
//
// If the application does not respond to the connection attempt in a timely manner,
// and we stop receiving communication from the client, the connection attempt will
// be timed out locally, transitioning the connection to the
// k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ProblemDetectedLocally state.  The client may also
// close the connection before it is accepted, and a transition to the
// k_ESteamNetworkingConnectionState_ClosedByPeer is also possible depending the exact
// sequence of events.

// A note about connection configuration options.  If you need to set any configuration
// options that are common to all connections accepted through a particular listen
// socket, consider setting the options on the listen socket, since such options are

// between chunks are not considered relevant, and the sizes of
